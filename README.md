BankY: Basic Banking System Simulation
BankY is a Java-based simulation of a basic banking system, developed during my internship with CipherByte Technologies. This project provides a practical implementation of fundamental banking functionalities, including account management and transactions, and serves as an excellent example of object-oriented programming and file-based data persistence.

Features
Account Management: Create new accounts, view account details, and manage account information.
Transactions: Perform deposits, withdrawals, and fund transfers between accounts.
Persistent Storage: Utilizes Java serialization for saving and loading account data.
Technologies Used
Java: Core language for implementing the banking system.
Serialization: For persistent data storage in files.
